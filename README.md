# howManyLands
Given an input list of cards in a Magic: the Gathering deck, calculates how many "land" cards should be played


The program processes a given list of cards in a deck, then references each card name with a list of all printed Magic: the Gathering Cards. Originally the program used an excel spreadsheet of numerous printed Magic cards, but in order to include all possible cards I switched to a JSON file from mtgjson.com
